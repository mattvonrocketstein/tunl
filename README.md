ABOUT
=====
Tunl is a dead-simple tunnel manager.  I wrote this mainly because I wanted both command-line and programmatic access to a ssh-tunnel manager with simple configuration files.  Also I can't be bothered to remember the difficult command line syntax, and I hate typing.

INSTALLATION
=======================================

```shell
   $ git clone https://github.com/mattvonrocketstein/tunl.git
   $ cd tunl
   $ virtualenv venv
   $ source venv/bin/activate
   $ pip install -r requirements.txt
   $ python setup.py develop
```
